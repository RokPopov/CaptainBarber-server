# ðŸª’Captain Barber ðŸª’

Captain Barber is a portfolio project where you can search for barbershops in Amsterdam, see and write their reviews, rate them and add new barbershops. You can see the information about the services they provide so you can compare the prices and decide where to book your appointment. You can also find contact information for each barbershop and locate them on a map, so you always know where to go to get that clean cut.

## Goals for this Project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app, implementing backend and frontend technologies.
This is the backend of the project, where I am trying to:

- build a working prototype in two weeks
- apply the technologies I learned in Codaisseur Bootcamp
- showcase and document development skills using:
  - wireframes as Minimum Viable Product
  - data model design
  - kanban project approach
  - transparant and structured git version control

## Technologies Used

- Express
- REST API
- Sequelize ORM
- PostgreSQL

## Git Version Control

In this project I try to implement solid version control:

- write clear commit messages
- name branches by features
- do pull requests with meaningful summaries

## Sample requests with axios

To demo making request to this server, some small script are included that make requests using `axios`

The scripts can be found in [/sampleRequests](https://github.com/RokPopov/CaptainBarber-server/tree/development/sampleRequests)

1. Make sure to follow the the setup in this readme first
2. cd sampleRequests
3. Run example requests

```
node hello.js
node echo.js
node signup.js
node login.js
node me.js
node authorizedPost.js
```

## Sample requests with httpie

To demo making request to this server, bash commands are included that make requests using `httpie`

They can found in [./sampleRequests/httpie.md](https://github.com/RokPopov/CaptainBarber-server/blob/development/sampleRequests/httpie.md)

Or run the commands seperately

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
